 An Assembly (MASM) remake of a small prank program I made in the high schoolðŸ¥´

---
It simply moves the mouse cursor to a random distance (but up to 30 pixels) and in a random direction every 1/3 of a second. Endlessly.

Saving it here for sentimental and historical reasons. I always wanted to implement this program in Assemlby ever since I wrote it, but I lacked the necessary knowledge to do it back then. Today I randomly rememberd about it and finally was able to close that gestalt.
